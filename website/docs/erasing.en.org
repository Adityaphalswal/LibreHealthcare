#+LANGUAGE: en

First of all, you must know that simply deleting a file by any operating system (open or not) or formatting a hard drive, is not sufficient to permanently delete data from this hard drive.

These methods are not sufficient for the actual application of the medical confidentiality, such as when a health professional wants to replace a working computer in which are located potentially personal unencrypted patients' data.

The objective of the protocol described on this page is:
- That no one can manage to recover any data in memory after application of this protocol. 
- That it is reusable by everyone, which means based on Free Softwares.

This protocol is of course updated according to the state of knowledge.
